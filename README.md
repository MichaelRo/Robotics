This code is developed for the legendary Robot Igal

Todo List:
  1. Check why the yaw is 20° when the localizationManager is set
  2. Change grid resolution to 10x10
  3. Fix the issue with the last point - somehow robot Igal get stuck right before it
  4. Add processing after the PathPlanner, to fix the waypoints issue
  5. When the first chosen yaw (neededYawDelta) is negative, robot Igal sticks to the wall and can't move.
     Add yaw change for obstacle avoidence
  6. Check what happens when yaws getting greater than 360° (for example, delta's addition)
  7. Add notes to all class files, delete the unimportant notes and delete unused methods.
  8. Save the planet from the Gay Iranian community missle.
