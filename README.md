Todo List:
  1. Check why the waypoints gets to the MovementManager as (0,0) or nan points
  2. Check if the waypoints are really different than the points that the robot returns (the player) 
     (Maybe we need to multiply in map resolution)
  3. Make GoToPoint try again when he fails to get to the correct point
  4. Check why the Particle's belief doesn't calculates well / at all (maybe something with the previous belief factor)
  5. Clear unimportant console prints and add the relevant ones
  6. Clean unused consts
  7. Add notes to all class files
