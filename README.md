Todo List:
  1. Check why the yaw change is slower when the localizationManager is set
  2. Decide what to do with the case that we want to choose quadrant and the y or the x is the same
  3. Sometimes the neededYawDelta gets negative and the robot gets in between the tables (one step before the other tables)
  4. Check what is the issue with the obstacle avoidance
  5. Fix the issue with the last point - somehow robot Igal get stuck right before it
  6. Add processing after the PathPlanner, to fix the waypoints issue
  7. Add notes to all class files, delete the unimportant notes and delete unused methods.
  8. Add methods to Manager (methods like init map)
  9. Save the planet from the Gay Iranian community missle.
