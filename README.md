Todo List:
  1. Check why the waypoints gets to the MovementManager as (0,0) or nan points
  2. Check that the waypoints conversion to map resolution really works
  3. Make GoToPoint try again when he fails to get to the correct point
  4. Check why the Particle's belief doesn't calculates well / at all (maybe something with the previous belief factor)
  5. Add matching between the current particle yaw and the robot's laser equalization (by it's yaw)
  5. Clear unimportant console prints and add the relevant ones
  6. Clean unused consts
  7. Add notes to all class files
