This code is developed for the legendary Robot Igal

Todo List:
  1. Check why robot Igal goes to a different yaw (greater than needed)
  2. Check why the route doesn't go straight at the first intersection (and generates two waypoints instead)
  3. Add yaw change for obstacle avoidence
  4. Make GoToPoint try again when he fails to get to the correct point
  5. Check the particle's isObsticleDetectedAsExpected method
  6. Clear unimportant console prints and add the relevant ones
  7. Clean unused consts
  8. Add notes to all class files
