This code is developed for the legendary Robot Igal

Todo List:
  1. Check why the yaw is 20Â° when the localizationManager is set
  2. Decide what to do with the case that we want to choose quadrant and the y or the x is the same
  3. Fix the issue with the last point - somehow robot Igal get stuck right before it
  4. Add processing after the PathPlanner, to fix the waypoints issue
  5. When the first chosen yaw (neededYawDelta) is negative, robot Igal sticks to the wall and can't move.
     Add yaw change for obstacle avoidence
  6. Check what happens when yaws getting negative (for example, delta's addition)
  7. Add notes to all class files, delete the unimportant notes and delete unused methods.
  8. Add methods to Manager (methods like init map)
  9. Save the planet from the Gay Iranian community missle.
