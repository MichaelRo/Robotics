Todo List:
  1. Somehow when robot Igal's gets to his first waypoint, the neededYawDelta gets negative (while he turns in place)
  2. Add yaw change for obstacle avoidence
  3. Check why the route doesn't planned to go straight at the first intersection (and generates two waypoints instead).
  4. Check what happens when yaws getting greater than 360Â° (for example, delta's addition)
  5. Clear unimportant console prints and add the relevant ones.
  6. Clean unused consts and methods.
  7. Add notes to all class files, and delete the unimportant / debug notes.
  8. Reorder all files in new directories
  9. Save the planet from the Gay Iranian community missle.
