This code is developed for the legendary Robot Igal

Todo List:
  1. Check why the robot goes to a different yaw (almost 180Â°) - looks like it depends on the conversion (robot to real)
  2. Check why the route doesn't go straight at the first intersection (and generates two waypoints instead)
  3. Add yaw change for obstacle avoidence
  4. Make GoToPoint try again when he fails to get to the correct point
  5. Check why the Particle's belief doesn't calculates well / at all (maybe something with the previous belief factor)
  6. Clear unimportant console prints and add the relevant ones
  7. Clean unused consts
  8. Add notes to all class files
